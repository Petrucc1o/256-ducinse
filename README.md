it rolls dices!
how to use: just type 1d20 or 1d20+3 or 99999d99999 and it will (hopefuly) roll it for you, my fellow discord-based-rpg player

- outputs non polished dice info, i'll work on formating the output text after all the basic funcionalities are done
- at this point it just roll and store values ex.: 1d20+8+1d3, the habillity to operate with * and - will be added soon
